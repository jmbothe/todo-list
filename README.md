## Description

Every newbie coder must at some point commit themselves to completing a todo list app tutorial. I was lucky enough to stumble across @gordonmzhu's [Watch and Code - Practical Javascript](https://watchandcode.com/p/practical-javascript) tutorial. This was an absolute game changer for me. Working through this tutorial was a long and gratifying series of "a-ha's" and "eureka's", and completing the tutorial really solidified my commitment to continuing on the path to becoming a web developer.

#### How is JavaScript used in this todo list app?
* To setup listeners for events like clicks and other user input.
* To animate interactive elements.
* To dynamically manipulate text content.
* And much, much more!
